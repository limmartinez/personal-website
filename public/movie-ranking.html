<p>
    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br />
    The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br />
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br />
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br />
                             But O heart! heart! heart!<br />
                                O the bleeding drops of red,<br />
                                   Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br />
                                      Fallen cold and dead.<br />
                                    </p>
